        <p>My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books! Whenever I have free time, I read. My almirah is filled with books of all genres. Reading is a great habit which everyone should develop from very young age itself.

            Most of the time, it requires little or no electricity to engage in reading, so you're not burning up watts and adding to your energy bill. If you read outside or in a well-lit house, there's no cost at all during daytime hours. Reading is a good hobby that will not only improve your imagination but also allows you to escape your daily routine. When you read a good book you can really get lost in the story. A book gives you the chance to escape your daily reality and experience a whole new world!

            1. You visit a different world every time you read a book.
            <br /> 2. It makes you live the life of a protagonist.
            <br /> 3. When you're reading, you gain from the knowledge and experiences of someone else.
            <br /> 4. Reading fiction often puts you in different places and situations, making you a lot more imaginative!
            <br /> 5. Reading makes you empathetic because you gain a better understanding of people and the world.
